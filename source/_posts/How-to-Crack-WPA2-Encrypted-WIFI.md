<h2><u>What is WPA2 Encryption?</u></h2>

<p class = "tab" >WPA2 encryption is  short for "Wi-Fi Protected Access 2" which is a method used to secure a network. 
WPA2 encryption is currently the most popular wireless encryption where more than 60% of people use it according to 
<a href="https://wigle.net/stats#" >Wigle.net</a> (as of the date of this article, the link should provide a more 
accurate percentage).
Other protocols that make up a smaller percentage are WEP, WPA, and WPA3 (currently a next-gen protocol). </p>

<p class = "tab">Many WPA2 encrypted networks use PSK (Pre-Shared Key) as the method for authentication to the
network and AES as the encryption method for the network which is provided by the router. Due to the ubiquity of WPA2-PSK 
encryption for home routers, that's what will be discussed in this article.</p>

<h2><u>Overview</u></h2>

<p class="tab"> The 
<a href="https://amzn.to/2PLBi7D">i-Blason Rugged Case</a>
 is a nice, ruggedly designed, snugly fitting case for the new 16 inch MacBook Pro. Which can help protect your
 MacBook Pro from dirt, dust, drops, and bumps, all in one "slim", shock-absorbent package. I've currently used this
 case for almost a month and have had no complaints so far. Although the case isn't as slim as some other cases, I'm 
 okay with it since the added bulk from the rubberized corners give better protection if the laptop is ever dropped. 
 The case clips on to the frame of the MacBook Pro and hugs
 the laptop to keep it firmly attached. There's no movement of the case on the laptop after installation, plus, 
 as many might be wondering, there isn't any blockage of the cooling vents on the laptop, so you won't have to worry
 about blocking any airflow with this thoughtfully designed case. So if you're looking for a case to protect your
 new 16 inch MacBook Pro, this

  would be a wonderful choice.</p>

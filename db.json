Which can help protect your\n MacBook Pro from dirt, dust, drops, and bumps, all in one \"slim\", shock-absorbent package. I've currently used this\n case for almost a month and have had no complaints so far. Although the case isn't as slim as some other cases, I'm \n okay with it since the added bulk from the rubberized corners give better protection if the laptop is ever dropped. \n The case clips on to the frame of the MacBook Pro and hugs\n the laptop to keep it firmly attached. There's no movement of the case on the laptop after installation, plus, \n as many might be wondering, there isn't any blockage of the cooling vents on the laptop, so you won't have to worry\n about blocking any airflow with this thoughtfully designed case. So if you're looking for a case to protect your\n new 16 inch MacBook Pro, this \n <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2PLBi7D\">iBlason MacBook Pro case</a>\n  would be a wonderful choice.</p>\n  <div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"column\"><h2><u>Pros</u></h2>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Rugged design grants 360° protection from bumps, scrapes, and drops.</li>\n        <li>Precise cutouts grant full access to all ports and features.</li>\n        <li>Elevated, rubberized corners and vented for safe heat disbursement.</li>\n        <li>Peace of mind that your laptop is protected.</li>\n    </ul>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column\"><h2><u>Cons</u></h2>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Unable to use a 2 plug dock that requires the dock to be flush with the laptop.</li>\n        <li>Slightly bulky when compared to other cases that do not have rubberized corners.</li>\n    </ul>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  \n <a href=\"https://amzn.to/34NBHec\"><h3>Click here to check out this case.</h3></a>\n \n  \n</html>  ","source":"_posts/i-Blason-Rugged-Case-for-MacBook-Pro-16-inch-Review.md","raw":"---\ntitle: i-Blason Rugged Case for MacBook Pro 16 inch Review\ndate: 2019-12-22 19:17:45\ntags: Review, MacBook Pro 16 inch case\n---\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n\n<p><i>Disclaimer: The Fake Hacker is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program \ndesigned to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

<img src=\"/img/iBlason MacBook Pro case.png\" height=\"50%\" width=\"50%\"></a>\n\n<h2><u>Overview</u></h2>\n\n<p class=\"tab\"> The \n<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2PLBi7D\">i-Blason Rugged Case</a>\n is a nice, ruggedly designed, snugly fitting case for the new 16 inch MacBook Pro. Which can help protect your\n MacBook Pro from dirt, dust, drops, and bumps, all in one \"slim\", shock-absorbent package. I've currently used this\n case for almost a month and have had no complaints so far.

This \nhandshake, if captured can be used to figure out the password for the WPA2 encryption. So, in the following methods, our \ngoal will be to capture this handshake when a device connects to the router, so we can then take this handshake and \nuse it to find the password to connect to the WIFI. One of the limitations of this brute force method is you are \nguessing different passwords until you get the right one, so unless you guess the correct password, you won't be able to \nget the password. Thus, having a good password list is essential or having some clues to what the password might be \nso you can make your own password list to use. \nAlright, let's get started!\n </p>\n \n <h2><u>1. Setting Up Monitor Mode</u></h2>\n <p class=\"tab\">The first step is to set your wireless adapter to monitor mode so we can see the packets. Please note \n that I would not recommend you use the internal wifi card of your computer to do this for a couple of reasons: 1. \n most internal wifi cards are not compatible with Kali Linux and/or do not support monitor mode. 2. If you use the\n internal wifi card of your computer in monitor mode, you won't be able to connect to wifi from that wifi card. Thus, \n I would instead recommend using an external wifi card that is compatible with Kali Linux and capable of monitor mode. \n </p>\n \n <p> First, we'll need to see our network interfaces to make sure Kali can see the wireless adapter we're \n using. By entering the command below, we'll be able to see the network interfaces connected to the system.\n <br>\n <br>\n <code>ifconfig</code>\n <br>\n <br>\n <img src=\"/img/crackWPA2/ifconfig pic.png\" height=\"50%\" width=\"50%\">\n \n <br>\n As we can see in the image, <b>wlan0</b> is the wireless adapter I'm using for this demonstration. The eth0 is the bridge\n for the internet connection in the virtual machine.\n </p>\n \n <p>\n Next, we'll set our external wifi card to monitor mode. To do this, we'll do the following process.\n </p>\n \n <p>First, check the wireless network interfaces with the following command: </p>\n <br>\n <code>iwconfig</code>\n <br>\n <br>\n <img src=\"/img/crackWPA2/iwconfig.png\" height=\"50%\" width=\"50%\">\n <br>\n \n <p>To set our external wifi card to monitor mode, use the following commands:</p>\n <code>ifconfig wlan0 down</code> <br>\n <code>iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor</code><br>\n <code>ifconfig wlan0 up</code><br>\n <br>\n <p>Then, we'll check to make sure the adapter is in monitor mode:</p>\n <code>iwconfig</code><br>\n <br>\n \n <p>After this, you should have the same as in the following picture:</p>\n <img src=\"/img/crackWPA2/monitor_mode.png\" height=\"50%\" width=\"50%\">\n \n <h2><u>2. Getting the Handshake</u></h2>\n <p>The first thing we'll need to do is make sure to kill ALL of the potentially problematic pids with the following\n command:</p>\n <code>airmon-ng check kill</code>\n <br>\n <br>\n <p>After killing potentially problematic pids, we can now start to capture packets with the following command:</p>\n <code>airodump-ng wlan0</code>\n <br>\n <br>\n<p>After running this command, you should see the different packets that your wireless adapter is able to pick up. \n<i><br>Note: airodump-ng by default only scans 2.4GHz channels which is what will be used for this tutorial.</i>\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>You should end up with a table similar to the following, showing the nearby network packets captured:</p>\n<img src=\"/img/crackWPA2/wifi_networks.png\" height=\"50%\" width=\"50%\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>Next, we'll focus on our target wifi network and to capture packets on for this network. The following command, does \nthis after we provide the necessary information.</p>\n<p>General Format:</p>\n<code>airodump-ng -c (channel number) --bssid (bssid of target network) -w (path of file for captured data) (wireless adapter name)</code>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<code>airodump-ng -c 1 --bssid B2:72:BF:DA:1C:9D -w /root/Documents/handshake wlan0</code>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"/img/crackWPA2/airodump_no_handshake.png\" height=\"70%\" width=\"70%\">\n<p class=\"tab\">After this step, your computer will be monitoring the packets on the network you specified waiting for a handshake to \noccur when a device connects to the network. So until a device connects to the network and your wireless adapter is able \nto capture the handshake, you'll have to wait. Another option is to deauthenticate a device already connected to the \nnetwork so when it reconnects to the network, you can capture the handshake (see the deauthencation section below for\nhow to do this. When the handshake is captured, in the upper right-hand corner, you should see \"WPA Handshake: \" \nfollowed by the BSSID of the network you're monitoring.</p>\n<img src=\"/img/crackWPA2/airodump_handshake.png\" height=\"70%\" width=\"70%\">\n<br>\n<p>After getting the handshake, it should be saved to the path you used in the previous command. Next, we're \n   going to crack the password using the handshake we got and saved.</p>\n\n<h4>Deauthentication</h4>\n<p class=\"tab\">When deauthenticating an accessing point, the deauth packets can be sent to either a specific device on the network if you know \nthe MAC of the device or deauth ever device on the network if you don't know the specific MAC address of a device. We'll \nbe deauthenticating every device on the network for this since it's a simpler command and doesn't require us to find the \nMAC address of a connected device. One important thing to note about this is there must be a device connected to the \naccess point (router) in order for us to deauth a device which forces it to reauthenticate, allowing us to capture the \nhandshake. To deauthenicate devices from a router, run the following command in a new terminal ( leave the terminal you\nhave open from the previous step that's listening to the traffic of the target network):</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<code> aireplay-ng -0 100 -a B2:72:BF:DA:1C:9D wlan0</code>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>-0</strong> means deauthenticate</li>\n<li><strong>100</strong> is number of deauth packets to send; if 0 means it'll continuously send deauth packets </li>\n<li><strong>-a B2:72:BF:DA:1C:9D</strong> is the MAC address of the access point (router) </li>\n<li><strong>wlan0</strong> is our wireless interface name</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After running the deauth command successfully, you should get something similar to this:</p>\n<img src=\"/img/crackWPA2/deauth.png\">\n\n<h2><u>3. Cracking the Password</u></h2>\n<p class=\"tab\">There are many options of different software for cracking passwords such as Ophcrack, John the Ripper, Hashcat, etc. \nHowever, we'll be using aircrack-ng for this tutorial. One of the most important things when brute forcing a password is \nto have a good word list. Since if the correct password isn't in the list, you won't be getting the password. So your \nchoices here are to either use a pre-made list of passwords or if you have an idea of what the password could be, you can\nalso create your own password list using something like Crunch. For this tutorial, I'll be using the rockyou.txt list \nthat comes pre-downloaded on Kali Linux (you will have to unzip the file first to get the text file in the path: \n/usr/share/wordlists).</p>\n\n<p>To use aircrack-ng to brute force the password, use the following:</p>\n<p>General Format:</p>\n<code>aircrack-ng -w (word list path) -b (bssid of target network) (path of handshake file)</code>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<code>aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -b B2:72:BF:DA:1C:9D /root/Documents/handshake-01.cap</code>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>After running the above command, each password in the list you provided will be tested until there is a match. \nAfterwards, you should see something as below:</p>\n<img src=\"/img/crackWPA2/crack_pic.png\" height=\"70%\" width=\"70%\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>As we can see in the above picture, the password for my wifi network I was testing is \"password\" and it only took \n1 second to find the password using the rockyou word list. This is just to show for those out there with a easy to guess or common password, \nyou should change your password to something that isn't simple or easy to guess :)</p>\n","source":"_posts/How-to-Crack-WPA2-Encrypted-WIFI.md","raw":"---\ntitle: How to Crack WPA2 Encrypted  WIFI\ndate: 2019-11-16 14:48:54\ntags: WPA2 Encryption\ncategories: Info\ndescription: \"How to crack WPA2 encrypted wifi using Kali Linux and get the password\"\n---\n\n<p><i>Disclaimer: This information is purely for educational purposes. <strong> DO NOT </strong> try any of the techniques \ndescribed in this article unless you have proper authorization by the network admin to do so <strong>OR </strong> \nyou own the network.

Another option is to deauthenticate a device already connected to the \nnetwork so when it reconnects to the network, you can capture the handshake (see the deauthencation section below for\nhow to do this.

One important thing to note about this is there must be a device connected to the \naccess point (router) in order for us to deauth a device which forces it to reauthenticate, allowing us to capture the \nhandshake. To deauthenicate devices from a router, run the following command in a new terminal ( leave the terminal you\nhave open from the previous step that's listening to the traffic of the target network):</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<code> aireplay-ng -0 100 -a B2:72:BF:DA:1C:9D wlan0</code>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>-0</strong> means deauthenticate</li>\n<li><strong>100</strong> is number of deauth packets to send; if 0 means it'll continuously send deauth packets </li>\n<li><strong>-a B2:72:BF:DA:1C:9D</strong> is the MAC address of the access point (router) </li>\n<li><strong>wlan0</strong> is our wireless interface name</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After running the deauth command successfully, you should get something similar to this:</p>\n<img src=\"/img/crackWPA2/deauth.png\">\n\n<h2><u>3.
